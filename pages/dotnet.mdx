## .NET SDK

### Overview
This provides an interface for interacting with UTxORPC compatible nodes. It currently only includes the `SyncServiceClient`, which allows you to fetch blocks and follow the tip of the blockchain.

### Installation

To install the SDK, you can add the NuGet package to your project:

```bash
dotnet add package Utxorpc.Sdk
```

### Getting Started
<Callout type="note">
    The following code samples assume that the UTxORPC node is running locally on `localhost:50051`. If your node is hosted remotely or on a different server, replace `"http://localhost:50051"` with the appropriate server URL and port for your environment. 
    
    For more details on configuring your node, refer to the [UTxORPC Ecosystem Servers Documentation](/servers).
</Callout>

Hereâ€™s how you can start using the `SyncServiceClient` to interact with the UTxORPC.

#### 1. Initialize the Client

Here's how to initialize the client:
```csharp
using Utxorpc.Sdk;

var headers = new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    { "api-key", "" },
};

var client = new SyncServiceClient(
    url: "http://localhost:50051",
    headers
);
```
This sample is structured in a way that can be used if your UTxORPC node comes from a provider and you need to attach needed information to your header.

#### 2. Follow the Tip of the Blockchain

The `FollowTipAsync` method allows you to receive real-time updates as the blockchain progresses. You need to provide a `BlockRef` or a Block Reference to indicate where you want to start following.

```csharp
using Utxorpc.Sdk.Models;
using Utxorpc.Sdk.Models.Enums;

await foreach (NextResponse? response in client.FollowTipAsync(
    new BlockRef
    (
        "b977e548f3364b114505f3311a10f89e5f5cf47e815765bce6750a5de48e5951",
        58717900
    )))
{
    Console.WriteLine("___________________");
    switch (response.Action)
    {
        case NextResponseAction.Apply:
            Block? applyBlock = response.AppliedBlock;
            if (applyBlock is not null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Apply Block: {applyBlock.Hash} Slot: {applyBlock.Slot}");
                Console.WriteLine($"Cbor: {Convert.ToHexString(applyBlock.NativeBytes ?? [])}");
            }
            break;
        case NextResponseAction.Undo:
            Block? undoBlock = response.UndoneBlock;
            if (undoBlock is not null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Undo Block: {undoBlock.Hash} Slot: {undoBlock.Slot}");
            }
            break;
        case NextResponseAction.Reset:
            BlockRef? resetRef = response.ResetRef;
            if (resetRef is not null)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Reset to Block: {resetRef.Hash} Slot: {resetRef.Index}");
            }
            break;
    }
    Console.WriteLine("___________________");
}
```

This example listens for updates from the blockchain and handles them based on whether blocks are applied, undone, or reset.

#### 3. Fetch a Block

The `FetchBlockAsync` method retrieves a specific block by providing a `BlockRef`.

```csharp
BlockRef? blockRef = new BlockRef("b977e548f3364b114505f3311a10f89e5f5cf47e815765bce6750a5de48e5951", 58717900);
Block? block = await syncServiceClient.FetchBlockAsync(blockRef);

if (block is not null)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Block Hash: {block.Hash}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Block Slot: {block.Slot}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Block CBOR: {Convert.ToHexString(block.NativeBytes ?? [])}");
}
```
Certainly! Here's a conclusion in the same format typically used in Node.js documentation:

### Conclusion

The `SyncServiceClient` in this SDK offers streamlined access to blockchain data through intuitive methods like `FetchBlockAsync` and `FollowTipAsync`. With these tools, you can effortlessly integrate block retrieval and real-time blockchain monitoring into your .NET applications, enabling you to stay synchronized with the latest network state and react promptly to blockchain events.
